# Supabase Database Management through MCP

## Context
- When making any modifications to the Supabase database structure
- When creating or modifying database queries
- When adding new tables or columns
- When modifying existing database schema

## Requirements
- MUST use MCP server to verify database structure before making changes
- MUST create new migrations for all database modifications
- MUST wait for user approval before applying any database changes
- MUST validate schema changes through MCP queries first
- MUST document all proposed changes in the migration file
- MUST include rollback procedures in migrations

## Examples
<example>
// Good: Using MCP to verify and create migration
1. Query current structure through MCP
2. Propose changes with migration file
3. Wait for user approval
4. Apply changes after confirmation
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// Bad: Direct database modification without MCP
1. Directly modifying Supabase schema
2. Skipping migration creation
3. Not verifying structure through MCP
</example>

## Process Flow
1. Use MCP__query to check current database structure
2. Create migration file with proposed changes
3. Validate changes through MCP
4. Present changes to user for approval
5. Apply approved changes
6. Verify successful application
