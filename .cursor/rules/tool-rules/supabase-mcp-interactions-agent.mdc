description: This rule governs Supabase database modifications using MCP. It should be applied whenever: (1) Making changes to database structure, (2) Creating or modifying database queries, (3) Adding tables or columns, (4) Modifying existing schema. The rule ensures consistent database management through migrations and proper structure verification. It's particularly important for maintaining data integrity and preventing drift between environments.

# Supabase Database Management through MCP

## Critical Rules

- MUST use MCP server to verify database structure before making changes
- MUST create new migrations for all database modifications
- MUST wait for user approval before applying any database changes
- MUST validate schema changes through MCP queries first
- MUST document all proposed changes in the migration file
- MUST include rollback procedures in migrations

## Examples

<example>
// Good: Using MCP to verify and create migration
1. Query current structure through MCP
2. Propose changes with migration file
3. Wait for user approval
4. Apply changes after confirmation
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// Bad: Direct database modification without MCP
1. Directly modifying Supabase schema
2. Skipping migration creation
3. Not verifying structure through MCP
</example>
